# First-Attempt-with-Responsive-Site
My first project to try responsive site creation with media queries concept, still new to this so make it using multiple css files.
try to add contact form with my pure code, send data to local json. and maybe try to pull data from it later.


to Use Post method on server you should run 

npm install -g json-server (as static server don't support POST / PUT / DELETE Methods)

then run the server 

json-server --watch Data-base/db.json --port 3001
